## üì∏ Project Overview

This project is a proof of concept for a virtual AI doctor that combines:

- **Speech-to-Text (STT)** to understand patient queries
- **Vision + LLM** to interpret uploaded medical images and generate responses
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** to respond with a human-like doctor‚Äôs voice
- **Gradio UI** to bring it all together in an interactive web app
